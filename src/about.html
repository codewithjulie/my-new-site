    <p class="mb-8">I am a self-taught developer with a passion for education and building communities. I began my journey
      about two years ago and have learned so much and made amazing friendships along the way.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I have high expectations and I strive to improve each day. If you're interested in learning Ruby more
      deeply or want to share your knowledge, join me on twitter or send me an email. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
